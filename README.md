# win32exploits
#### Millenium MP3 Studio 2.0
This is a new take on a simple windows BoF exploit.  It requires a user to open the exploit file locally on the machine - this is not a remote attack.

Windows Security - App & browser control - Exploit protection settings on modern Windows versions is enabled by default.  Part of this protection suite is Data Execution Prevention (DEP) which prevents stack execution which is needed for a traditional (historical) BoF (buffer overflow) attack.  This exploit defeats DEP using ROP to call VirtualAlloc to turn off DEP on the stack.  

One other protection that Windows Security enables by default is Real-time protection.  This protection will (usually) catch reverse shell exploits like this but not until after the connection has been made.  In developing this exploit I had mixed results with this protection.  Sometimes it triggered and sometimes it didn't.  I mention it here to make the user aware - the exploit does not attempt to defeat this protection.
